====================

# This is a biometric lock utilizing PIN, and a Finger Print Scanning module.
# This project is already optimized to a certain degree, it can already ask for pin/finger input on first start up + setup
# Has memory to store user pin and finger check and authenticate using memory.
# It can be expanded to save up to as many finger prints and passwords the engineer/designer/user wants.
# The PCB is designed using the same concept as one of my other projects, "keypadPCB" but with additions for the bolt lock,etc..
# I designed the hardware using KiCAD an ECAD Software
